# keygen

Example: 

* ./keygen nass-api-gateway-test

This command will create a directory named nass-api-gateway-test with a private and public key pair of the same name inside of it; the CN:OU assigned to the certificate will be: `nass-api-gateway-test:nass-api-gateway-test`. A p12 file will also be generated, with the password you chose during the script. This file can be imported into browsers and REST clients.
